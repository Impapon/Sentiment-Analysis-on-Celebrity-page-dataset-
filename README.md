# Sentiment Analysis on Celebrity page dataset



#Note:  

In the code section i have saved all my algorithm Performances in a Json file(In a separate path)
For using my code you need to create the path as like as mine from the Libraries section(Top of the code).

the path is  : path ='/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/NLP Projects/Sentiment Analysis/' 

![path](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53019982/123207581-6f989c00-d4df-11eb-82f9-4355b75df4a3.PNG)
![json](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53019982/123207681-9a82f000-d4df-11eb-8704-5c5ba1cdd0c0.PNG)





If you want to save your code in your desire  path then you have to  change the path as your own interest.
